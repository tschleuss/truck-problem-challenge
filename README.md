# Truck Problem Challenge

Given a list of trucks and their current locations and a list of cargos and their pickup and delivery destinations, find the optimal mapping of trucks to cargos to minimize the overall distances all trucks must travel.


Assume:
1. Each truck can only carry up to one cargo and each truck can only make up to one trip.
2. Variable of calculating the cost of return trip for the truck back to its original start point is not
needed.
3. Distance should be calculated using geographical distance - not using roads.
